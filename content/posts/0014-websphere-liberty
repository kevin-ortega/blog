I am pleased to announce that [WebSphere Liberty](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-liberty) is now included in the [Paketo Liberty](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/liberty) buildpack and available to currently entitled WebSphere Liberty users. WebSphere Liberty is built on [Open Liberty](openliberty.io) and is a lightweight, efficient, Javaâ„¢ EE, Jakarta EE and MicroProfile cloud-native runtime.

The Paketo Liberty buildpack now gives you a choice to use WebSphere Liberty or Open Liberty to run your application.

To use WebSphere Liberty in your container, set the `BP_LIBERTY_INSTALL_TYPE` environment variable to specify the [install type](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/liberty#install-types) `wlp`:
```
 pack build --env BP_JAVA_APP_SERVER=liberty \
  --env BP_LIBERTY_INSTALL_TYPE=wlp \
  --buildpack paketo-buildpacks/eclipse-openj9 \
  --buildpack paketo-buildpacks/java myapp
```

Open Liberty continues as the default install type.

Just like Open Liberty, WebSphere Liberty offers a range of profiles to choose from.

The available profiles included in WebSphere Liberty:
* kernel
* jakartaee9
* javaee8
* javaee7
* webProfile9
* webProfile8
* webProfile7

The available profiles included with Open Liberty:
* kernel
* jakartaee9
* javaee8
* full
* webProfile9
* webProfile8
* microProfile5
* microProfile4

Set the `BP_LIBERTY_PROFILE` environment variable to specify the profile you want to use.
